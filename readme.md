SpeedyPNG is a command line PNG optimization tool written in Python 3.3 for Windows. It optimizes by running the PNG through pngcrush, OptiPNG, AdvPNG, PNGOUT and DeflOpt.

If I ever find the time, I will make this a cross-platform tool for OSX and Linux as well. 

## Requirements
- Windows (I only tested it on Windows 8)
- Python 3.3

## Usage:
