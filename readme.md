SpeedyPNG is a command line PNG optimization tool written in Python 3.3 for Windows. It optimizes by running the PNG through pngcrush, OptiPNG, AdvPNG, PNGOUT and DeflOpt.

## Requirements
- Python 3.3

It is currently only tested on Windows 8, but it _should_ work on posix systems as long as the binaries are available in the tools directory.

## Usage:

	python SpeedyPNG.py [FILES...]

## [Download](https://github.com/branneman/SpeedyPNG/archive/master.zip)

## Roadmap
 - Create useful exitcode, and make runtests.py run a quieted version and watch for the exit code.
 - Add tool binaries for posix, and test them on linux and osx.
 - Rename project to 'SpeedyImages'
   - Add jpeg support with jpegoptim, jpegrescan, jpegtran.
   - Add svg support with svgo.
 - Create os-specific application binaries, so the 'python app.py' syntax isn't necessary anymore.
 - Add 'overall report' when finished multiple files.
 - Add support for iterating a directory recursively.
 - Add a GUI.
